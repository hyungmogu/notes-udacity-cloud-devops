# Sending Alert Messages

- `Prometheus` has alot of channels of communication to use for alerts

- Helpful alerting include
    - a. providing a brief description of the problem (easier to understand, the better)
    - b. stack trace and source code if code-related issues occur
    - c. URL if it can be used by engineer to troubleshoot the problem

- NOTE: MAKE SURE TO KEEP ALERTS SIMPLE (ALERT FATIGUE)
