# Monitoring System

1. Monitoring system is like a three legged stool
    - Not useful when one leg is taken away
    - The three legs are:
        1. Data Aggregator
            - is a tool that collects and groups data by type or data source
            - e.g. Database with extra tooling to aid in data collection
        2. Data Visualizer
            - Takes copious amounts of unintelligible data from the data aggregator and produces charts and graphs that help us understand what the data is trying to say
        3. Time Series Data
            - Is made up of historical data points indexed in time order 
            - e.g. 
                - a. Blood sugar level checked at the top of every hour
                - b. Daily closing value of Microsoft stock
                - c. Monthly rainfall by city
                - d. Available disk space by the minute
