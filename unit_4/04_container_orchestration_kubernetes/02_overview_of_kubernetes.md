# Overview of Kubernetes

1. Kubernetes is useful for working with containerized applications

2. Kubernetes is a framework for running distributed systems at planet scale.
    - Google uses kubernetes to run billions of containers a week

3. Some of Kubernetes capability are:
    - a. High availability architecture
    - b. Auto-scaling
    - c. Rich ecosystem
    - d. Service discovery
    - e. Container health management
    - f. Secrets and container management

## The Basics of Kubernetes

1. Creating a Kubernetes cluster
2. Deploying an application to the cluster

## Kubernete's Architecture

1. `Cluster` is the core of Kubernetes
2. `Container` is run inside the `cluster`
3. `Kubernetes master` and `Kubernetes nodes` are core components of the `cluster`
3. Multiple pod can be contained inside a `Kubernetes node`
4. Multiple container and/or volumes can be contained inside a `Kubernetes node`
