# CI/CD Pipeline Integration (important)

## GitOps

1. Means using Git as a single source of truth
2. Uses diff to compare the desired state with the observed state
    - e.g. Terraform
3. All the intended operations are committed inside of a pool request

## More Notes

1. CircleCI is a great tool to help with CI
2. CircleCI works well with [Kubernetes](https://circleci.com/blog/k8s-deployments-with-cloudflare/)
